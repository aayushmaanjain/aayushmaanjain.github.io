# Month-in-Review: August 2020
### Health
1. **Exercise**: Surpassed the target of 20 mins daily by logging 628 minutes over 26 days.
I did 562 minutes/32 workouts with NTC and 66 minutes/8 workouts following [Lucy Wyndham-Read's Workout "to loose belly fat"](https://youtu.be/yL_dE81O_mw). This video has 77 million views and that got me curious. However, I didn't take measurements so I don't know how well it worked. I'll measure it now and continue it for another week and report my findings. ‚úîÔ∏è 

2. **Walking**: Walked 8370/7250 steps. ‚úîÔ∏è

3. **Weight**: I am at 66.3 kgs. As I am nearing my arbitrary goal of 66 kgs, I realise that I still need to burn a lot more fat and build muscles so the body fat % is healthy. Could this be a trackable metric? ‚úîÔ∏è


### Learning
4. **Reading**: Here are book's I made progress on:
   - *Autobiography of Malcolm X - by Alex Haley and Malcolm X* [fin]
   - *Atomic Habits - by James Clear* [fin]
   - *How to Win Friends and Influence People - by Dale Carnegie* [fin]
   - *The 4-Hour Workweek - by Tim Ferris*

   I have started actively logging on [Goodreads](www.goodreads.com/user/show/36625337) now. ‚úîÔ∏è

5. **Projects**: I had to build a MVP for the Django project idea. Made no progress. ‚ùå

### Art
6.  **Movies**: Again, I watched only 2 films this month. ‚ùå
    - *American Psycho (2000) - directed by Mary Harron*
    - *Project Power (2020) - directed by Henry Joost, Ariel Schulman* ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
    
    I document the films I watch [here](https://letterboxd.com/wanderwonder/).

7.  **Photo Documentation**: Missed a couple of days, but this is going fine. ‚úîÔ∏è

- When you retire old phones/laptops, remove the password barricade so that you can still access them when you forget the password. #LessonsLearntTheHardWay
